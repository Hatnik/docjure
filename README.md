# Docjure

Docjure makes reading and writing Office documents in Clojure easy.

## Usage

### Example: Read a Price List spreadsheet

    (use 'dk.ative.docjure.spreadsheet)       

    ;; Load a spreadsheet and read the first two columns from the 
    ;; price list sheet:
    (->> (load-workbook "spreadsheet.xlsx")
         (select-sheet "Price List")
         (select-columns {:A :name, :B :price}))

    ;=> [{:name "Foo Widget", :price 100}, {:name "Bar Widget", :price 200}]

### Example: Create a spreadsheet 
This example creates a spreadsheet with a single sheet named "Price List".
It has three rows. We apply a style of yellow background colour and bold font
to the top header row, then save the spreadsheet.

    (use 'dk.ative.docjure.spreadsheet)       
    
    ;; Create a spreadsheet and save it
    (let [wb (create-workbook "Price List"
                              [["Name" "Price"]
                               ["Foo Widget" 100]
                               ["Bar Widget" 200]])
          sheet (select-sheet "Price List" wb)
          header-row (first (row-seq sheet))]
      (do
        (set-row-style! header-row (create-cell-style! wb {:background :yellow,
                                                           :font {:bold true}}))
        (save-workbook! "spreadsheet.xlsx" wb)))
    

### Automatically get the Docjure jar from Clojars

The Docjure jar is distributed on [Clojars](http://clojars.org/dk.ative/docjure). 

If you are using the Leiningen build tool just add this line to the
:dependencies list in project.clj to use it:

    [dk.ative/docjure "1.8.0"]	

Remember to issue the 'lein deps' command to download it.

#### Example project.clj for using Docjure 1.7.0

    (defproject some.cool/project "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
      :description "Spreadsheet magic using Docjure"
      :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.6.0"]
                     [dk.ative/docjure "1.8.0"]])
